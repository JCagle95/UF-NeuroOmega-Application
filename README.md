# UF NeuroOmega Application (temporary)

## Active Development Branch
This is the active development branch for new features and new compatibility. The primary development platform was moved from QT Creator 4.2.0 to 4.15.0, and the codes are actively upgrading toward the current QT version: QT 6.1.0 at the time of development. As a result, this branch will not be compatible with older build-kit, especially that some signals are deprecated when switching from QT5 to QT6. 

## Active Development Feature
The primary goal of this branch is to build a new interface for real-time data streaming as a complementary interface to the existing stimulation control interface. This real-time data streaming is primary used for research purpose at the moment, but further development will incorporate resarch findings to provide real-time functional mapping.

## Build from Source
The source code of this application is provided as a QT project file. The source codes are written and tested in QT Creator 4.15, built with [Desktop QT 6.1.0 MinGW 64-bit] (https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.1_Release). QT 5 series are not longer supported in this branch.
